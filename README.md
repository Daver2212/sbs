This is the source code for the installation and control app for the first version of Android Native SBS support. Native SBS makes 
it possible to use all apps (like Plex, Play Movies, Netflix, etc.) with opendive, google cardboard or similar for viewing on a large virtual screen.

- This has only been tested on AOKP_jflte_kitkat_nightly_2014-05-24 (AOKP based on 4.4.2 on Samsung S4 - I9505)
- Installation might cause your phone to crash or freeze, but it doesn't do ANY permanent changes so a reboot should
  always help.
- Installation is not stable due to the fact that some drivers doesn't sometime crashes when we restart the framework, I've attempted
  to work around this by triggering the installation with the power button, which also deactivates the graphics.
- If installation fails, try again.
- If the phone hangs, reboot it.


I have a lot of projects, a day-job and doesn't have much time for this project, in addition estetics and user interfaces aren't my 
strong side. So if someone wants to help rewrite this into something useful I'd appreciate the help.
